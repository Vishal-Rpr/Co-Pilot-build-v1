# Task: Credit Limit Management Table -- UI Prototype

**Linked goal:** Client credit limit feature

---

## Objective
Build a clickable UI prototype of the Client Credit Limit Management table so Finance users can visualize the interface for maintaining, viewing, and updating client credit terms and exposure.

## Key goals
- Display all core credit fields: client name, account manager, general credit terms, assigned limit, current exposure, available credit, credit documentation
- Implement the credit exposure formula: `Sum of outstanding invoices (net of payments & adjustments) + customer-level debit notes - customer-level credit notes - unadjusted advances/payments`
- Include standard additional fields: credit rating, payment score, utilization bar, limit type, validity period, approval status, currency
- Support key Finance workflows: add new credit limit, revise credit terms, view detailed breakdown, upload documentation
- Show summary-level KPIs: total clients, total credit allocated, total exposure, over-limit count, expiring-soon count

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Prototype opens in any browser with no dependencies
